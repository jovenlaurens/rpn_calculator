# Reverse-Polish Notation Calculator

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator is a type of calculator that uses a postfix notation instead of the more traditional infix notation used by most calculators. An RPN calculator is one in which the operators appear after their respective operands, rather than between them. So, instead of computing the following: (2 + 3) \* 5, an RPN calculator would compute this equivalent expression as 2 3 + 5 \*.

RPN notation is convenient for several reasons. First, no parentheses are necessary since the computation is always unambiguous. Second, such a calculator is easy to implement given a stack.

## How to use the calculator

The calculator program is invoked with no arguments, and starts out with an empty stack. It takes its input from the standard input stream cin, and writes its output to the standard output stream cout. Each time an integer is entered by the user, it is pushed onto the stack. Some operations will pop integers off the stack or push new integers onto the stack. The stack only contains integers.

The following table gives the inputs your calculator must respond to and what you must do for each.
| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| An integer| An integer has the form as one or more digits [0 – 9] optionally starting with a minus sign “-” to denote a negative integer. An integer, when entered, is pushed onto the stack. You can assume all input integers and intermediate results are within the range [−2 31 , 2 31 − 1]. |
| + | Pop the top two numbers off the stack, add them together, and push the result onto the top of the stack. |
| - | Pop the top two numbers off the stack, assuming that the first popped number is a and the second is b, subtract the first number a from the second b (i.e., calculate b − a), and push the result onto the top of the stack. |
| \* | Pop the top two numbers off the stack, multiply them together, and push the result onto the top of the stack. |
| / | Pop the top two numbers off the stack, assuming that the first popped number is a and the second is b, divide the second popped number b by the first a using the integer division rule in C++ (i.e., calculate b/a by applying C++ arithmetic operator “/”), and push the result onto the top of the stack. |
| n | Negate: pop the top item off the stack, multiply it by ‐1, and push the result onto the top of the stack |
| d | Duplicate: pop the top item off the stack and push two copies of the number onto the top of the stack. |
| r | Reverse: pop the top two items off the stack, push the first popped item onto the top of the stack and then push the second item onto the top of the stack (this just reverses the order of the top two items on the stack) |
| p | Print: print the top item on the stack to the standard output, followed by a newline. |
| c | Clear: pop all items from the stack. |
| a | Print‐all: print all items on the stack in one line, from top‐most to bottom‐most, each followed by a single space. The end of the output must be followed by a newline. |
| q | Quit: exit the calculator.|

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have C++ installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository

2. Compile the project:

```
